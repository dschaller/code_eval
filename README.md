#![CodeEval Logo](https://www.codeeval.com/static/images/logo.png) Challenges
---

This project contains implementations of programming challenges from www.codeeval.com.

Find me on [CodeEval](https://www.codeeval.com/profile/d_a_schaller/).

A requirement for running any of these projects is that you have java installed and on your PATH. To run any of the projects execute the following commands in a command line.

```
./compileAndRun {challengeLevel}/{projectName}
```

For information around each of the challenges view the README in the specific directory.
